Subject: Request for Leave to Enjoy Extended Weekend

Dear Sir,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to request leave for an extended weekend, starting from 10/10/2024 and ending on 20/10/2024. This will give me the opportunity to take some time off and recharge. 

I plan to resume work immediately after this period, on 21/10/2024. I will ensure that all pending tasks are completed before my leave and will coordinate with the team to ensure a smooth workflow in my absence.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval. 

Best regards, 
xyz
