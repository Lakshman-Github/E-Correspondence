Subject: Request for Farewell Party to Celebrate Project Completion 

Dear Sir, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am pleased to inform you that our team has successfully completed the project. To celebrate this achievement and to bid farewell to some of our team members who will be moving on to new opportunities, I would like to request your approval to organize a farewell party. 

The proposed date for the event is 10/10/2024, and we plan to keep it a simple gathering within the office premises location. This would be a great opportunity for the team to reflect on our success and express our appreciation to those who contributed significantly to the project's success. 

Please let me know if you approve of this plan or if you have any suggestions regarding the arrangements. 

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to your response. 

Best regards,
