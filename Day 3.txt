Subject: Request for Leave from August 15th to August 25th

Dear Mr.Smith, 

I hope this message find you well. I am writing to request leave from August 15th to August 25th. During this time, I plan to take an extended weekend to relax and recharge.  

I have already completed most of my current tasks and I will ensure that any remaining work is taken care of before I leave. I will also coordinate with my colleagues to ensure a smooth workflow in my absence. 

I would appreciate it if you could approve my request. I look forward to returning to work on August 26th, fully refreshed. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

Best regards, 
John Doe
