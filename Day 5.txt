Subject: Request for Electrical Appliance Repairs in PG Room 

Dear Sir, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that several electrical appliances in our PG room are in need of repair. Specifically, the lights are not functioning properly, which is causing some inconvenience. 

Could you please arrange for someone from the maintenance department to check and repair these appliances at the earliest possible time? We would greatly appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. 

Thank you for your support. 

Best regards,
