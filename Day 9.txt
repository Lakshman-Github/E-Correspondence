Subject: Request for Leave to Attend Farewell Party

Dear Sir, 

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request leave from college on 10/10/2024 to attend a farewell party organized for close friend.

This event is significant to me, and I would greatly appreciate your approval for my absence on this day. 

I will ensure that I catch up on any missed lectures or assignments. 
Thank you for considering my request. 

Best regards,
